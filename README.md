## Overview

**TimeHarbor** empowers individuals to take control of their time tracking and reflection. Whether you're an employee, student, mentor, volunteer, or nonprofit contributor, TimeHarbor helps you understand how you spend your time, reflect on your work, and communicate your value—all while keeping your data private by default.

---

## Core Purpose

- **Empower individuals** (employees, students, mentors, volunteers) to track, reflect on, and communicate how they spend their time
- **Facilitate transparent, user-controlled sharing** of time and activity data with leadership, sponsors, teachers, or peers—only when the individual chooses
- **Act as a supportive coach and assistant**, focusing on personal growth and self-advocacy rather than surveillance

---

## Key Features

1. **Clock In/Clock Out:** Simple, intuitive interface for starting and ending work or project sessions
2. **Project & Objective Allocation:** Tag time entries to specific projects, objectives, or tasks (e.g., "robotics build," "grant writing," "classwork")
3. **Personal Reflection & Notes:** Add context, challenges, and accomplishments to each time entry, helping communicate value and obstacles
4. **User-Controlled Sharing:** All data remains private by default. Share with others (leaders, sponsors, teachers) only with explicit approval
5. **Role Flexibility:** Designed for employees, students, mentors, volunteers, and nonprofit contributors
6. **Reporting & Summaries:** Generate reports or summaries to share contributions, progress, or challenges as needed
7. **Coach/Assistant Persona:** Supportive tool that helps with personal growth and positive communication

---

## Design Principles

- **Privacy First:** No data is visible to others without user consent
- **Empowerment:** Helps users advocate for themselves, communicate their value, and reflect on their work
- **Non-Intrusive:** Avoids any "big brother" feel; the assistant is a buddy, not a monitor
- **Broad Applicability:** Useful for nonprofits, educational settings, and traditional workplaces

---

## User Roles

- **Individual User:** Primary role - tracks personal time, reflects on work, controls data sharing
- **Mentor/Leader:** Guides others while respecting their privacy; receives shared data only when offered
- **Student/Learner:** Tracks time on assignments, projects, and extracurriculars for personal growth and optional sharing
- **Volunteer/Contributor:** Logs hours and activities for personal records and grant/reporting purposes when needed

---

## Use Cases

- **FIRST Robotics Teams:** Mentors and students log time spent on projects, then selectively share summaries with sponsors or teachers
- **Nonprofits:** Volunteers track hours and activities, generating reports for grant applications or board meetings when needed
- **Students:** Track time spent on assignments or extracurriculars, sharing with teachers or parents as desired
- **Employees:** Document work on projects, reflect on challenges, and share progress with managers when ready
- **Personal Development:** Individuals track time on learning, hobbies, or goals for self-reflection and improvement

---
